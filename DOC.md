The normal algorithm is starting by calling the command "gradle run --args = 'file_path'" from the console. For example: file "text.txt" located in a directory "data", the command will take the following form - "gradle run --args='data/text.txt'". The format of the input data in the file is as follows: the first line is the line to be changed, the next n lines contain two values. The first - what we will change, the second - what we will change are written with a greater than sign (>). Note that the first parameter must be followed by a space, and only after the greater than sign (>). And for the second parameter, after the greater than sign (>), first there is a space, and only after the second parameter. Examples of the file uoy can find in the directory "data". The result of the program is outputting to the console.
